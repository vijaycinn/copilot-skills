# copilot-skills

A collection of [GitHub Copilot CLI](https://githubnext.com/projects/copilot-cli) agent skills for Microsoft field engineers. Each skill orchestrates MCP servers (MSX, WorkIQ, Azure tools) to automate common SE workflows — pipeline analysis, territory reporting, activity logging, and more.

---

## Available Skills

| Skill | Description | Audience |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| [`territory-insights`](./territory-insights/) | Generates a fully-grounded quarterly territory leadership update using live MSX pipeline, milestones, HoK activities, and WorkIQ customer emails/meetings. Outputs an 8-section HTML report ready to paste into Outlook. | Field SEs / DSEs |
| [`msx-territory-signal`](./msx-territory-signal/) | Generates SSP-ready outreach signal briefs from MSX performance exports plus seller-mapping files. Identifies chatter, momentum, and untapped accounts and can draft HTML outreach emails for Apps, AI, Infra, Data, or GitHub motions. | Field SEs / DSEs |
| [`se-activity`](./se-activity/) | Drafts and classifies MSX SE Activity entries from meeting notes, emails, or Teams conversations. Maps work to the correct FY26 SE Task Category and MSX scope (Account / Opportunity / Milestone). | Field SEs / DSEs |

## Prerequisites

All skills in this repo require:

| Requirement | Notes |
|-------------|-------|
| [GitHub Copilot CLI](https://github.com/github/gh-copilot) | `gh extension install github/gh-copilot` |
| MSX MCP Server | Microsoft internal — contact your CSA/DSE lead for setup |
| WorkIQ MCP Server | Microsoft internal — connects to Microsoft 365 Copilot |
| Python 3.8+ | For inline CSV analysis (ACR validation) |

> **Microsoft-internal only:** These skills use MSX (Microsoft Sales Experience) and WorkIQ (M365 Copilot) MCP servers that are only available inside the Microsoft corporate network. They are not usable externally.

## MCP / Dependency Matrix

No extra Copilot **plugin** is required beyond installing the skill folder itself into `~/.copilot/skills/`. The main runtime dependencies are **MCP servers** plus a few optional local tools.

| Skill | Required MCPs | Optional MCPs / tools | Notes |
|-------|---------------|------------------------|-------|
| [`territory-insights`](./territory-insights/) | **MSX MCP**, **WorkIQ MCP** | **Sales Home MCP** (`sales-home`) for MoM Apps + AI ACR signals; Python 3.8+ for CSV validation; Excel/CSV exports; Outlook/Mail permissions for draft creation | Best for live territory updates plus customer voice and milestone context |
| [`msx-territory-signal`](./msx-territory-signal/) | None for core local-file analysis | **MSX MCP** for opp / milestone context; **WorkIQ MCP** for chatter and meeting grounding; **Sales Home MCP** (`sales-home`) for territory-scoped MoM ACR ranking; Python 3.8+; account mapping XLSX/CSV; Outlook/Mail permissions for drafts | Core flow can run from local exports, but MCPs make it much more actionable |
| [`se-activity`](./se-activity/) | **MSX MCP** | **WorkIQ MCP** to pull notes from email / meetings / Teams | Can work from pasted notes alone, but MSX MCP is needed to validate scope cleanly |

### Quick verification before first run

1. Run `skills` and confirm the skill is listed
2. Run `/mcp` and confirm the required servers are connected
3. If using local-file workflows, confirm Python is on PATH and you have the MSX exports saved locally

**Current MCP names used in this repo:**
- `msx-mcp`
- `workiq`
- `sales-home` *(optional; Sales Home / MSXi ACR signal layer)*

## Installation

1. **Clone or download this repo**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vijaycinn/copilot-skills.git
   ```

2. **Copy the skill(s) you want to `~/.copilot/skills/`**

   ```powershell
   # Windows
   Copy-Item -Recurse .\territory-insights "$env:USERPROFILE\.copilot\skills\territory-insights"
   ```

   ```bash
   # macOS / Linux
   cp -r territory-insights ~/.copilot/skills/
   ```

3. **Verify the skill is loaded**

   Open a new Copilot CLI session and type `skills` — you should see `territory-insights` listed.

4. **Invoke the skill**

   ```
   territory-insights
   ```

   The skill auto-detects your identity and territory from MSX/M365. No config required for the first run.

## Personalizing a Skill (Optional)

Each skill supports a personal config file that you can create locally and will never be committed (it's in `.gitignore`):

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `my-config.md` | Your territory config: name, email, segment, ATU codes, workspace path |
| `my-accounts.md` | Your account engagement notes (use `references/ai-foundry-accounts.md` as template) |

To create your personal config:

1. Copy the template from each skill's README into a `my-config.md` file in the skill folder
2. Fill in your name, email, segment, ATU codes, and workspace path
3. Reference it when the skill prompts for corrections in Step 0

> `my-config.md` and `my-accounts.md` are in `.gitignore` — your personal config will never be committed.
